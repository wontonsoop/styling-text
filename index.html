      <p>Florence and the Machine have released a cover of No Doubt’s Tragic Kingdom single “<a href="https://florence.lnk.to/JustAGirl/">Just a Girl</a>”. It features in a new trailer for the second season of Showtime’s hit series Yellowjackets. Hear the cover and watch the trailer below.</p>
      <p>Florence and the Machine’s Florence Welch produced the new “Just a Girl” cover with Idles’ Mark Bowen. In a press statement, Welch said, “I’m such a huge fan of Yellowjackets and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a ‘deeply unsettling’ way for the show.” She continued, “We tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who’s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani it was a dream job.”</p>
